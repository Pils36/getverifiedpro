                        <p>Pro-Filr Inc. respects the intellectual property rights of others and desires to offer a
                            platform which contains no content that violates those rights. Our User Agreement requires
                            that information posted by Members be accurate, lawful and not in violation of the rights of
                            third parties. To promote these objectives, Pro-Filr Inc. provides a process for submission
                            of complaints concerning content posted by our Members. Our policy and procedures are
                            described and/or referenced in the sections that follow.</p>
                        <p>Please note that whether or not we disable access to or remove content, Pro-Filr Inc. may
                            make a good faith attempt to forward the written notification, including the complainant’s
                            contact information, to the Member who posted the content and/or take other reasonable steps
                            to notify the Member that Pro-Filr Inc. has received notice of an alleged violation of
                            intellectual property rights or other content violation. It is also our policy, in
                            appropriate circumstances and in our discretion, to disable and/or terminate the accounts of
                            Members, or groups as the case may be, who infringe or repeatedly infringe the rights of
                            others or otherwise post unlawful content.</p>
                        <p>Please note that any notice or counter-notice you submit must be truthful and must be
                            submitted under penalty of perjury. A false notice or counter-notice may give rise to
                            personal liability. You may therefore want to seek the advice of legal counsel before
                            submitting a notice or a counter-notice.
