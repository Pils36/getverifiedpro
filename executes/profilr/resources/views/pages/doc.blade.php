			Complaints regarding content posted on the Pro-EXECUTES website
		</h5>
		<p>
			Pro-EXECUTES respects the intellectual property rights of others and desires to offer a platform which contains no content that violates those rights. Our User Agreement requires that information posted by Members be accurate, lawful and not in violation of the rights of third parties. To promote these objectives, Pro-EXECUTES provides a process for submission of complaints concerning content posted by our Members. Our policy and procedures are described and/or referenced in the sections that follow. <br><br>
			Please note that whether or not we disable access to or remove content, Pro-EXECUTES may make a good faith attempt to forward the written notification, including the complainant’s contact information, to the Member who posted the content and/or take other reasonable steps to notify the Member that Pro-EXECUTES has received notice of an alleged violation of intellectual property rights or other content violation. It is also our policy, in appropriate circumstances and in our discretion, to disable and/or terminate the accounts of Members, or groups as the case may be, who infringe or repeatedly infringe the rights of others or otherwise post unlawful content. <br><br>
			Please note that any notice or counter-notice you submit must be truthful and must be submitted under penalty of perjury. A false notice or counter-notice may give rise to personal liability. You may therefore want to seek the advice of legal counsel before submitting a notice or a counter-notice.

		<h4>Cookies on Pro-EXECUTES</h4> <br>
		<p>
			At Pro-EXECUTES, we believe in being clear and open about how we collect and use data related to you. In the spirit of transparency, this policy provides detailed information about how and when we use cookies. This cookie policy applies to any Pro-EXECUTES product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference.
		</p> <br>
		<p>
			<b>Does Pro-EXECUTES use cookies?</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Yes. As described in Section 1.8 of our Privacy Policy, we use cookies and other technologies to ensure everyone who uses Pro-EXECUTES has the best possible experience. Cookies also help us keep your account safe. By continuing to visit or use our services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes we describe in this policy.
		</p> <br>
		<p>
			<b>What is a cookie?</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables Pro-EXECUTES features and functionality. For example, cookies enable us to identify your device, secure your access to Pro-EXECUTES and our sites generally, and even help us know if someone attempts to access your account from a different device. Cookies also enable you to easily share content on Pro-EXECUTES and help us serve relevant ads to you.
		</p> <br>
		<p>
			<b>When does Pro-EXECUTES place cookies?</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			We use cookies on our site and mobile applications. Any browser visiting these sites will receive cookies from us. We also place cookies in your browser when you visit non-Pro-EXECUTES that host our plugins or tags.
		</p> <br>
		<p>
			<b>What types of cookies does Pro-EXECUTES use?</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			We use two types: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie helps us recognize you as an existing user, so it's easier to return to Pro-EXECUTES or interact with our services without signing in again. After you sign in, a persistent cookie stays in your browser and will be read by Pro-EXECUTES when you return to one of our sites or a partner site that uses our services. Session cookies only last for as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).
		</p> <br>
		<p>
			<b>What are cookies used for?</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Cookies can be used to recognize you when you visit Pro-EXECUTES, remember your preferences, and give you a personalized experience that's in line with your settings. Cookies also make your interactions with Pro-EXECUTES faster and more secure. Additionally, cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off the Pro-EXECUTESs, and bring customized features to you through Pro-EXECUTES plugins such as our "Share" button.

Similarly, our partners may use a cookie to determine whether we've shown an ad and how it performed, or provide us with information about how you interact with ads.

			<b>What is Do Not Track (DNT)?</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies, for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups, Internet browsers, technology companies, and regulators to develop a DNT technology standard. While some progress has been made, it has been slow. No standard has been adopted to this date. As such, Pro-EXECUTES does not use "do not track" signals.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>How are cookies used for advertising purposes?</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Cookies and other ad technology such as beacons, pixels, and tags help us serve relevant ads to you more effectively. They also help us provide aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for advertisers, understand and improve our service, and know when content has been shown to you. Note: Because your web browser may request advertisements and beacons directly from ad network servers, these networks can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.
			If you are logged in on Pro-EXECUTES.com, or another Service that references this Cookie Policy or browsing a third party partner site of Pro-EXECUTES and one of our cookies on your device identifies you, your usage (such as your browsing behavior) and log data (such as your IP address), will be associated by us with your account as noted in Section 1.6 of our Privacy Policy. We also use aggregate data from third parties and data from your profile and Pro-EXECUTES activity.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are a Pro-EXECUTES member but logged out of your account on a browser, Pro-EXECUTES may still continue to log your interaction with our services on that browser for up to 30 days in order to generate usage analytics for our services, which analytics we may share in aggregate form with our advertising customers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unless you clear these cookies from your browser, we may use this information to:
			<ul class="container service-area" style="margin-top: 0">
				<li style="list-style-type: square; font-style: italic;">provide more relevant, interest-based advertising</li>
				<li style="list-style-type: square; font-style: italic;">provide aggregate reports of ads activity to advertisers and websites hosting the ads</li>
				<li style="list-style-type: square; font-style: italic;">help website and app owners understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps</li>
				<li style="list-style-type: square; font-style: italic;">detect and defend against fraud and other risks to protect users and partners</li>
				<li style="list-style-type: square; font-style: italic;">improve our products</li>
			</ul>
			We do not provide any personal information that we collect to advertisers. You can opt-out of off-site and third-party-informed advertising by adjusting your settings. Please note that opting out will not remove advertising from the pages you visit; it will mean that the ads you see may not be matched to your interests. If you are not a Pro-Filr.com member, learn more about cookies and how to opt out.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>What third-party cookies does Pro-Filr.com use?</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Our cookie table lists some of the third party cookies on our sites. Please note that the names of cookies, pixels and other technologies may change over time.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Controlling cookies</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it will no longer be personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>What to do if you don't want cookies to be set or want them to be removed?</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			If you don't want us to use cookies when you visit Pro-Filr.com, you can opt-out of some cookies on your settings page. In order for us to recognize that you have opted out of cookies, we have to place our Pro-Filr.com opt-out cookie on your device so we can know not to set other Pro-Filr.com cookies the next time you visit. If you do not want to receive cookies, you can also change your browser settings on your computer or other device you're using to access our services. If you use Pro-Filr.com without changing your browser settings, we'll assume that you're happy to receive all cookies on the Pro-Filr.com website. Most browsers also provide functionality that lets you review and erase cookies, including Pro-Filr.com cookies. Please note that the Pro-Filr.com will not work properly without cookies.

				<h4>What information we collect</h4>
				<ul class="container service-area" style="margin-top: 0">
					<li>
						<h5>1.1 Data Controllers</h5>
						<p>
							Our Privacy Policy applies to any Member or Visitor. We collect information when you use our Services to offer you a personalized and relevant experience, including growing your network and enabling business opportunities.
							The personal information provided to or collected by our Services is controlled by Pro-EXECUTES Inc, 10 George St. North, Brampton. ON L6X 1R2 Canada in respective of your location. <br> <br>
							<b>If you have any concern about providing information to us or having such information displayed on our Services or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, you should not become a Member, visit our websites, apps or otherwise use our Services.</b> If you have already registered, you can close your accounts. We collect your personal information in the following ways:
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h5>1.2 Registration</h5>
						<p>
							When you create an account with us, we collect information (including your name, email address, and password).
							To create an account on Pro-EXECUTES, you must provide us with at least your name, email address and/or mobile number, and a password and agree to our <span style="color: #5cb85c">User Agreement</span> and this Privacy Policy, which governs how we treat your information. You may provide additional information during the registration flow (for example, your postal code, job title, and company) to help you build your profile and to provide you more customized services (for example: language-specific profile pages, updates, content, more relevant ads and opportunities). You understand that, by creating an account, we and others will be able to identify you by your Pro-EXECUTES profile. We may also ask for your credit card details if you purchase certain additional services.

						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h5>1.3 Profile Information</h5>
						<p>
							We collect information when you fill out a profile. A complete Pro-EXECUTES profile that includes professional details – like your job title, education, and skills – helps you get found by other people for opportunities.
							After you create an account, you may choose to provide additional information on your Pro-EXECUTES profile, such as descriptions of your skills, professional experience, and educational background. You can list honors, awards, professional affiliations, Group memberships, networking objectives, companies or individuals that you follow, and other information including content. Subject to the settings you choose, your connections may provide recommendations and endorsements of you. Providing additional information enables you to derive more benefit from our Services by helping you express your professional identity; find other professionals, opportunities, and information; and help business opportunities find you. It also enables us to serve you ads and other relevant content on and off of our Services.

						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h5>1.4 Address Book and Other Services That Sync with Pro-EXECUTES</h5>
						<p>
							We collect information when you sync non-Pro-EXECUTES content – like your email address book, mobile device contacts, or calendar – with your account. You can remove your address book and any other synced information whenever you like.
						</p>
						<p>
							You may use our address book or “contacts” importer (or other similar features) to upload your address book into our Services. We store this information (including phone numbers) and use it to help you manage and leverage your contacts in connection with our Services. We also use this information to enhance your experience with our Services by helping you to grow your network by: identifying your contacts that are already Members of our Services; providing a template to send invitations on your behalf to your contacts that are not Members; and suggesting people you may know (even if not in your contacts) but are not yet connected with you on our Services (as we may infer from your shared connections or shared managers, employers, educational institutions and other such factors). We may also use this information to show you and other Members that you share the same uploaded contacts who may or may not be Members.
						</p>
						<p>
							Please note that when you send an invitation to connect to another individual on our Service (a “connection”) or to join our Service to connect with you, that person may have access to your email address or, for SMS invitations, mobile number because it may be displayed in the invitation. After sending these invitations, we may also remind your invitees of your invitation on your behalf. Your Pro-EXECUTES connections will also have access to your email address.
						</p>
						<p>
							We make other tools available to sync information with our Services, and may also develop additional features that allow Members to use their account in conjunction with other third-party services. For example, our mobile applications allow you to sync your device’s calendar, email and/or contacts apps with our Services to show you the Pro-EXECUTES profiles of meeting attendees, email correspondents and/or your contacts.
						</p>
						<p>
							Another example are software tools that allow you to see our and other public information about the people you email or meet with and leverage our Services to help you gain insights from and grow your network. If you grant these products (mobile applications or our other Services that sync external email and calendar services, such as “Pro-EXECUTES Links”) permission to access your email and calendar accounts, they will access and may store some of your email header and calendar history information. Our products that sync with external email services may also temporarily cache message content for performance reasons, in a way that is unreadable by us and our service providers.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Any information that you upload or sync with our Services is covered by the User Agreement and this Privacy Policy. You can remove your information at your convenience</b> using the features we make available or in accordance with Section 3. You can remove your address book and any other synced information at any time.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h5>1.5 Customer Service</h5>
						<p>
							We collect information when you contact us for customer support. <br> <br>
							When you contact our customer support services (e.g. on our Help & Feedback), we may have to access your Intra-Mails, Groups/Forum and other contributions to our Services and collect the information we need to categorize your question, respond to it, and, if applicable, investigate any breach of our User Agreement or this Privacy Policy. We also use this information to track potential problems and trends and customize our support responses to better serve you. We do not use this information for advertising

						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h5>1.6 Using the Pro-EXECUTES Sites and Applications</h5>
						<p>
							We collect information when you visit our Services (i.e. Pro-EXECUTES), use our mobile applications, and interact with advertising on and off our Services. <br><br>
							We collect information when you use (whether as a Member or a Visitor) our websites, applications, our platform technology (such as “Share on Pro-EXECUTES” plugins for publishers) or other Services. For example, we collect information when you view or click on ads on and off our Services, perform a search, import your address book, join and participate in Groups/Forum, participate in polls, install one of our mobile applications. If you are logged in on Pro-EXECUTES.com.com, or another Service or one of our cookies on your device identifies you, your usage information and the log data described in Section 1.10 of this policy, such as your IP address, will be associated by us with your account. Even if you’re not logged into a Service, we log information about devices used to access our Services, including IP address.

						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h5>1.7 Using Third-Party Services and Visiting Third-Party Sites</h5>
						<p>
							We collect information when you use your account to sign in to other sites or services, and when you view web pages that include our plugins and cookies.
						</p>
						<p>
						You allow us to receive information when you use your account to log in to a third-party website or application. Also, when you visit a third-party site that embeds our social plugins (such as “Share on Pro-EXECUTES” for publishers) we receive information that those pages have loaded in your web browser. If you are logged in as a Member when you visit sites with our plugins, we use this information to recommend tailored content to you. We will use this information to personalize the functionality we provide on third-party sites, including providing you insights from your professional network and allowing you to share information with your network. Our retention of this data is addressed in Section 3.2. We may provide reports containing aggregated impression information to companies hosting our plugins and similar technologies to help them measure traffic to their websites, but no personal data.
						</p>
						<p>
							You also allow us to receive information about your visits and interaction with the sites and services of our partners that include our cookies and similar technologies, unless you opt out. If you are not a Member, we rely on the online terms between you and our partners.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h5>1.8 Cookies</h5>
						<p>
							We use cookies and similar technologies to collect information. <br><br>
							As described in our <a href="{{ url('/render/cookie') }}" style="color: #5cb85c">Cookie Policy,</a> we use cookies and similar technologies, including mobile application identifiers, to help us recognize you across different Services, learn about your interests both on and off our Services, improve your experience, increase security, measure use and effectiveness of our Services, and serve advertising. You can control cookies through your browser settings and other tools. <b>By visiting our Services, you consent to the placement of cookies and beacons in your browser and HTML-based emails in accordance with this Privacy Policy, which incorporates by reference our <a href="{{ url('/render/cookie') }}" style="color: #5cb85c">Cookie Policy</a>.</b>

						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h5>1.9 Advertising Technologies and Web Beacons</h5>
						<p>
							We use advertising technologies and web beacons to collect information. We give you a number of ways to opt out of targeted ads, including through the Ad Choices icon shown with any ads we serve on third-party sites. If you do not want us to track your behavior on third-party sites, you can opt out.
							 <b>If you do not opt out, you consent to our use of beacons and other advertising technologies.</b>
							We target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others both on and off of our Services through a variety of ad networks and ad exchanges, using the following, whether separately or combined:

						</p>

						<ul class="service-area" style="margin-top: 0">

									We do not share your personal information with any third-party advertisers or ad networks for advertising without your separate permission. Note that, as described in Section 2.6, your profile is visible to other Members and through public search depending on your settings. Also, advertising partners may associate personal information collected by the advertiser directly from you with our cookies and similar technologies. In such instances, we contractually require such advertisers to obtain your explicit opt-in consent before doing so.
									We may show you sponsored content in your network update stream (NUS), which will be designated as sponsored content and will behave like other NUS updates.

									We adhere to self-regulatory principles for interest based advertising. If you wish to not receive targeted ads from most third party companies, you may opt-out as described here.

						<h5>1.10 Log Files, IP Addresses, and Information About Your Computer and Mobile Device</h5>
						<p>
							We collect information from the devices and networks that you use to access our Services. <br><br>
							When you visit or leave our Services (whether as a Member or Visitor) by clicking a hyperlink or when you view a third-party site that includes our plugin or cookies (or similar technology), we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came or the one to which you are directed. Also, advertisers receive the URL of the page that you are on when you click an ad on or through our Services. We also receive the internet protocol (“IP”) address of your computer or the proxy server that you use to access the web, your computer operating system details, your type of web browser, your mobile device (including your mobile device identifier provided by your mobile device operating system), your mobile operating system (if you are accessing Pro-EXECUTES using a mobile device), and the name of your ISP or your mobile carrier. We may also receive location data passed to us from third-party services or GPS-enabled devices that you have set up, which we use to show you local information on our mobile applications and for fraud prevention and security purposes. Most mobile devices allow you to prevent real time location data being sent to us, and of course we will honor your settings. <br><br>
							In the case of our Android apps, you will be provided notice of the types of data (e.g. location) that will be sent to us. If you choose to use our app after this notice, we process this data to enable registration or preview product features for you (e.g. jobs near you).

						<h5>1.11 Other</h5>
						<p>

							Our Services are a dynamic, innovative environment, which means we are always seeking to improve the Services we offer you. We often introduce new features, some of which may result in the collection of new information (for example, Validation of Profile information, we began collecting information about skills for which Members were validated and the profile of individuals who validated them). Furthermore, new partnerships or corporate acquisitions may result in new features, and we may potentially collect new types of information. If we start collecting substantially new types of personal information and materially change how we handle your data, we will modify this Privacy Policy and notify you in accordance with Section 4.3.

							We communicate with you using Pro-EXECUTES messaging, email, and other ways available to us. We may send you messages relating to the availability of the Services, security, or other service-related issues. We also may send promotional Intra-Mail messages to your Pro-EXECUTES inbox. You can change your email settings at any time. <br><br>
							We communicate with you through email, notices posted on the Pro-EXECUTES websites or apps, messages to your Pro-EXECUTES Intra-Message inbox, and other means available through the Services, including mobile text messages and push notifications. Examples of these communications include: (1) welcome and engagement communications - informing you about how to best use our Services, new features, updates about other Members you are connected to and their actions, etc.; (2) service communications - these will cover service availability, security, and other issues about the functioning of our Services; (3) promotional communications - these include both email and Intra-Mail messages (Intra-Mail messages are only delivered to your Pro-EXECUTES InBox), and may contain promotional information directly or on behalf of our partners, including business opportunities. These messages will be sent to you based on your profile information and messaging preferences. We track the open rate of your Intra-Mails to provide your Intra-Mail acceptance score. You may change your email and contact preferences at any time by signing into your account and changing your Pro-EXECUTES email settings. You can also opt out of promotional messages by sending a request to Pro-EXECUTES Help Center.
							Please be aware that you cannot opt out of receiving service messages from us.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h5>2.3 User Communications</h5>
						<p>
							With certain communications you send on our Services, the recipient can see your name, email address, and some network information. <br><br>
							Many communications that you initiate through our Services (for example, an invitation sent to a non-Member) will list your name and primary email address in the header of the message. Messages you initiate may also provide the recipient with aggregate information about your network (for example, how many people are in your network). Other communications that you initiate through the Services, like a request for an introduction, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your personal email address contact information. Once you have connected with an individual, regardless of who sent the invitation, your contact information will be shared with that individual. <br><br>
							We use automatic scanning technology to help protect you and other Members. Such technology checks links and other content in your Intra-Mails, network updates and Group contributions to help us identify and block malicious links and malware, reduce spam and optimize the delivery of our Services.

					</li>

						<h5>2.4 Service Development; Customized Experience</h5>

							We use the information and content you provide to us to conduct research and development and to customize your experience and try to make it relevant and useful to you. <br><br>
							We use information and content that you and other Members provide to us to conduct research and development for the improvement of our Services in order to provide you and other Members and Visitors with a better, more intuitive experience and drive membership growth and engagement on our Services and to help connect professionals to economic opportunity. <br>
							We also customize your experience and the experiences of others on our Services. For example, when you sign in to your account, we may display the names and photos of new Members who have recently joined your network or recent updates from your connections and companies you follow. We try to show you content, such as news and presentations, that is relevant to you, your industry, or your profession. We also use Members information and content for invitations and communications promoting our Services that are tailored to the recipient.

						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h5>2.5 Sharing Information with Affiliates</h5>
						<p>
							We share your information across our different Services, among companies in the Pro-EXECUTES family. <br><br>
							We may share your personal information with our affiliates (meaning entities controlled by, controlling or under common control with Pro-EXECUTES) outside of the Pro-EXECUTES entity that is your data controller (for example, Pro-EXECUTES Inc. may share your information with Pro-EXECUTES Limited, or other Pro-EXECUTES operating entities) as reasonably necessary to provide the Services. You are consenting to this sharing.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h5>2.6 Sharing Information with Third Parties</h5>
						<p>

							Other people may find your Pro-EXECUTES profile information through search engines (you can choose which parts of your public profile are accessible to public search engines in your settings), or use services like Twitter in conjunction with your Pro-EXECUTES account.

						</p>
						<p>
							We offer a “public profile” feature that allows you as a Member to publish portions of your professional profile to the public Internet. This public profile will be indexed and displayed through public search engines when someone searches for your name. You may choose the parts of your profile that search engines index or completely opt out of this feature in your Pro-EXECUTES account settings. However, third-party search engines may not automatically update their caches, which may contain old public profile information. Unless you delete them, your profiles on Pro-EXECUTES and our corresponding app are always viewable on the respective Services.
							The display of your professional profile to other Members depends on your degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of the Services, access channels and search types (e.g. by name or by keyword). For example, first degree connections can see your full profile and contact information. Others have more limited access, as detailed in our Help Center. Please note that classic subscribers can see your full profile even if you did not approve their Intra-Mail. <br><br>

							We do not rent or sell personal information that you have not posted on our Services, except as described in this Privacy Policy. We will not disclose personal information that is not published to your profile or generated through engagement with our other services, such as Groups/Forum and Company Pages, except to carry out your instructions (for example, to process payment information) or unless we have your separate consent, unless we have a good faith belief that disclosure is permitted by law or is reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with a legal requirement or process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce this Privacy Policy or our User Agreement; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties; (4) respond to Member service inquiries; or (5) protect the rights, property, or safety of Pro-EXECUTES, our Services, our Members, Visitors, or the public. See Section 2.14 for additional details about our compliance with legal requests for information.

						</p>
						<p>
							We support middleware providers that offer archiving solutions to firms subject to legal and regulatory archiving requirements, which, with your permission, facilitate the archiving of your communications and other activity by a third party for compliance purposes. Content distributed through our sharing features and third-party integrations may result in displaying some of your personal information outside of our Services. For example, when you post content to a Group that is open for public discussion, your content, including your name as the contributor, may be displayed in search engine results. <br><br>
							Also, if you have opted to bind any of your Service accounts to your Twitter, Facebook or other similar account, you can easily share content from our Services to these third party services, in accordance with your account settings (which you may change at any time) and respective policies of these third parties. Further, we allow third parties to look-up profile information (subject to your privacy settings) using your email address or first and last name information through its profile API (see Section 2.7 below). <br><br>
							Third parties (for example, your email provider) may give you the option to upload certain information in your contacts stored with us onto their own service. If you choose to share your contacts in this way, you will be granting your third party provider the right to store, access, disclose and use these contacts in the ways described in such third party's terms and privacy policy.

							If you have given a Platform Application access to your Pro-EXECUTES account, you can revoke that permission anytime. Also, you can opt out of providing information to developers through your connections. <br><br>
							We collaborate with and allow third parties to use our developer platform to offer services and functionality in conjunction with our Services. These third-party developers have either negotiated an agreement to use our platform technology or have agreed to our self-service API and Plugin terms in order to build applications (“Platform Applications”). Both the negotiated agreements and our API and Plugin terms contain restrictions on how third parties may access, store, and use the personal information you provide to us. <br><br>
							If you choose to use a Platform Application, you will be asked to confirm acceptance of the privacy policy and user agreement of the third-party developer. To revoke permission granted to a Platform Application, please visit your settings. Note, however, that even if you revoke the permission granted to a Platform Application, your connections may still be using the Platform Application, so the Platform Application may still have access to certain information about you, just as your connections do. You may opt out of providing information to third-party developers through your connections by accessing the “Turn on/off data sharing with third-party applications” control in the “Groups/Forum, Companies, and Applications” tab under settings.

We or third parties may follow up with you via Intra-Mail regarding your participation unless you have opted out of receiving Intra-Mail messages. We may use third parties to deliver incentives to you to participate in surveys or polls. If the delivery of incentives requires your contact information, you may be asked to provide personal information to the third party fulfilling the incentive offer, which will be used only for the purpose of delivering incentives and verifying your contact information. It is up to you whether you provide this information, or whether you desire to take advantage of an incentive.

You may opt out of participating in surveys by changing your settings to stop receiving these inquiries and requests.
