                        <p>At Pro-Filr.com, we believe in being clear and open about how we collect and use data related
                            to you. In the spirit of transparency, this policy provides detailed information about how
                            and when we use cookies. This cookie policy applies to any Pro-Filr.com product or service
                            that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference.</p>
                        <h4 class="ui header">Does Pro-Filr.com use cookies?</h4>
                        <p>Yes. As described in Section 1.8 of our Privacy Policy, we use cookies and other technologies
                            to ensure everyone who uses Pro-Filr.com has the best possible experience. Cookies also help
                            us keep your account safe. By continuing to visit or use our services, you are agreeing to
                            the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes we describe in this policy.</p>
                        <h4 class="ui header">What is a cookie?</h4>
                        <p>A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables Pro-Filr.com features and
                            functionality. For example, cookies enable us to identify your device, secure your access to
                            Pro-Filr.com and our sites generally, and even help us know if someone attempts to access
                            your account from a different device. Cookies also enable you to easily share content on
                            Pro-Filr.com and help us serve relevant ads to you.</p>
                        <h4 class="ui header">When does Pro-Filr.com place cookies?</h4>
                        <p>We use cookies on our site and mobile applications. Any browser visiting these sites will
                            receive cookies from us. We also place cookies in your browser when you visit
                            non-Pro-Filr.coms that host our plugins or tags.</p>
                        <h4 class="ui header">What types of cookies does Pro-Filr.com use?</h4>
                        <p>We use two types: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie helps us
                            recognize you as an existing user, so it's easier to return to Pro-Filr.com or interact with
                            our services without signing in again. After you sign in, a persistent cookie stays in your
                            browser and will be read by Pro-Filr.com when you return to one of our sites or a partner
                            site that uses our services. Session cookies only last for as long as the session (usually
                            the current visit to a website or a browser session).</p>
                        <h4 class="ui header">What are cookies used for?</h4>
                        <p>Cookies can be used to recognize you when you visit Pro-Filr.com, remember your preferences,
                            and give you a personalized experience that's in line with your settings. Cookies also make
                            your interactions with Pro-Filr.com faster and more secure. Additionally, cookies allow us
                            to bring you advertising both on and off the Pro-Filr.coms, and bring customized features to
                            you through Pro-Filr.com plugins such as our "Share" button.</p>

                                    information about how you interact with ads. We may also work with a partner to show

                        <h4 class="ui header">What is Do Not Track (DNT)?</h4>
                        <p>DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies, for the Internet industry to
                            develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of
                            their online activities across websites by using browser settings. The World Wide Web
                            Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups, Internet browsers, technology
                            companies, and regulators to develop a DNT technology standard. While some progress has been
                            made, it has been slow. No standard has been adopted to this date. As such, Pro-Filr.com
                            does not use "do not track" signals.</p>
                        <h4 class="ui header">How are cookies used for advertising purposes?</h4>
                        <p>Cookies and other ad technology such as beacons, pixels, and tags help us serve relevant ads
                            to you more effectively. They also help us provide aggregated auditing, research, and
                            reporting for advertisers, understand and improve our service, and know when content has
                            been shown to you. Note: Because your web browser may request advertisements and beacons
                            directly from ad network servers, these networks can view, edit, or set their own cookies,
                            just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</p>

                            Privacy Policy. We also use aggregate data from third parties and data from your profile and

                            that opting out will not remove advertising from the pages you visit; it will mean that the

                        <p>Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, if
                            you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user
                            experience, since it will no longer be personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving
                            customized settings like login information.</p>

                            removed?</h4>
                        <p>If you don't want us to use cookies when you visit Pro-Filr.com, you can opt-out of some
                            cookies on your settings page. In order for us to recognize that you have opted out of
                            cookies, we have to place our Pro-Filr.com opt-out cookie on your device so we can know not
                            to set other Pro-Filr.com cookies the next time you visit. If you do not want to receive
